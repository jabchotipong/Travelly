# About The Project
This project is a travel agency website. It was built by HTML and CSS. I did this project because I want to practice my HTML and CSS skills that are very useful and basic skills for all web developers.

# What I Got From This Project
* Style a plain HTML page with CSS
* Practice flexbox
* Create a little animation by using CSS
* Responsive web design by using CSS for every device and screen size
