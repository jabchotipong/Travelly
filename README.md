# About The Project
Travelly is a travel agency website. This is my first project after I started learning about frontend development. It was only built by HTML and CSS that are basic fundamentals of frontend development. I built it to showcase my skills and improve my self-confident.

# What I Got From This Project
* Style a plain HTML page with CSS
* Practice flexbox
* Create a little animation by using CSS
* Responsive web design by using CSS for every device and screen size
